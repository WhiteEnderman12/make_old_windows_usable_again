# Welcome to "Make old windows usable again"

## what is this?
this repository is dedicated to a software that I'm currently working on that will make old windows usable again on the modern web.

## what does it do?
the software will feature stuff like fresh and new windows updates, a https to http conversion proxy, a email server that acts as a middleman for modern email services in order to be able to send mails and a Newsgroup server. But thats only what I'm currently planing.

## what have you finnished?
I have currently only finished the proxy, but its still in a kinda buggy state. I also have made some fresh new patches for windows 95 but haven't gotten around making a windows update client to download these. Also I have gotten the Email server to send Emails but recieving them is still not possible.
