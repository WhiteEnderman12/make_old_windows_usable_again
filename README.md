# Welcome to "Make old windows usable again"

## what is this?
this repository is dedicated to a software that I'm currently working on that will make old windows usable again on the modern web.

## what does it do?
the software will feature stuff like fresh and new windows updates, a https to http conversion proxy, a email server that acts as a middleman for Gmail in order to be able to send mails and a Newsgroup server. But thats only what I'm currently planing.

## what have you finnished?
I have barely finished anything, but heres a list of what I have finished or at what completion state it's currently in (green = finished, orange = still in development or buggy behavior, red = not working or not started yet):
- HTTPS to HTTP Proxy ✅
- Gmail to Outlook express 🟨
- Newsgroup server 🟨
- Windows updates ❌
